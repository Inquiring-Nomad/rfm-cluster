**Clustering of online customers based on RFM values**

Recency (R) as days since last purchase: How many days ago was their last purchase? Deduct most recent purchase date from today to calculate the recency value. 1 day ago? 14 days ago? 500 days ago?

Frequency (F) as total number of transactions: How many times has the customer purchased from our store? For example, if someone placed 10 orders over a period of time, their frequency is 10.

Monetary (M) as total money spent: How many $$ (or whatever is your currency of calculation) has this customer spent? Again limit to last two years â€“ or take all time. Simply total up the money from all transactions to get the M value.
